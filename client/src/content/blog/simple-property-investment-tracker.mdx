Hi, Iâ€™m JoÃ£o Tripa, founder of **Domari**.

Iâ€™m not a property investor yet, but I plan to be. What Iâ€™ve noticed, time and again, is that most landlords still manage their rental properties with spreadsheets.

Sure, it works â€” but itâ€™s messy. Endless tabs, broken formulas, version chaos, files scattered everywhere. Honestly, I donâ€™t want to go through that.

So, as a software developer, I decided to build something better.

That's how **Domari** came to life: a simple web app that helps landlords and property investors track income, expenses, and cash flow for all their properties in one organized place.

## Getting Started Is Simple

I designed Domari with simplicity in mind so anyone can get started in minutes.

- **Add your property** on the Properties page
- **Add a transaction** on the Transactions page and link it to your property

Thatâ€™s it! From there, just keep adding transactions as they happen and everything stays organized.
As your portfolio grows, simply add more properties.

## Visualize Your Performance

Your data turns into clear insights.
Interactive charts show income and expenses over time, helping you track monthly trends and see exactly where your money goes.

Domari automatically calculates:

- **Cash flow** for each property
- **Return on investment (ROI)** based on your initial investment
- **Expense ratios** to spot where your money is going
- **Month-over-month trends** to catch problems early

You can just focus on the numbers and make smarter decisions based on your portfolio performance.

## Export for Tax Time

When tax season arrives, export all transactions in **CSV format** with categories, dates, and amounts. Give your accountant organized data instead of scattered receipts.

## Who This Is For

This is built for landlords and property investors who value simplicity.
If you're looking for a straightforward property investment tracker, not a complex management tool, this is made for you.

## Try It Free
